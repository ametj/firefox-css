# firefox-css
My personal firefox customization.

Uses customized [Simplify Darkish Yellow theme](https://github.com/CristianDragos/FirefoxThemes) (button style changes), removes megabar, shows bookmar bar only when urlbar is focused and uses customized scrollbars.

# Installation

1. Turn on `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` in `about:config`

2. Create the `chrome` folder, _if not already present_, in the Firefox profile folder you want to use this theme with. You can find all the browser profiles in `about:profiles`.

3. Clone this repo's content into the `chrome/` folder previously mentioned.

4. Done.

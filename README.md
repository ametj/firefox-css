# firefox-css
My personal firefox customization.

Uses dark compact theme, inspired by [Simplify Darkish Yellow theme](https://github.com/CristianDragos/FirefoxThemes).

# Installation

1. Turn on `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` in `about:config`

2. Create the `chrome` folder, _if not already present_, in the Firefox profile folder you want to use this theme with. You can find all the browser profiles in `about:profiles`.

3. Clone this repo's content into the `chrome/` folder previously mentioned.

4. Done.

# Development
Check [how to setup live debugging](https://old.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/73dvty/tutorial_how_to_create_and_livedebug_userchromecss/).

Browser toolbox is not opening? Delete `chrome_debugger_profile` in the Firefox profile folder. Check installation section for locating the folder.
